We have a very good knowledge of the location. In fact part of the local steering committee is living in Istanbul. Further, we have successfully organized many events even larger than ECSA in Istanbul. We are planning to work with two professional groups to hold the event, one will be the "event counselor" and the other will be "public relations counselor" as we have been doing with all our previous events.
