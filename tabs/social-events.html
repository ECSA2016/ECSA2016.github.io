There are a huge number of excellent options for organizing social events in Istanbul. We will not name these all here. But we are planning to have a 2-3 hours "dinner boat trip" through famous Bosphorus, the connection between Europe and Asia. Moreover, a gala dinner can be set up with special cultural dancing and music performance such as "whirling ceremony". Gala dinner will be held in a 5-stars or 4-stars hotel listed in Accommodation section.
