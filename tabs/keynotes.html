                <h3>Engineering cyber-physical systems â€“ A paradim shift in software architectures?</h3>
                <p>New business models, smart data and industrial internet applications are buzzwords on the first glance. But they are a little more than just buzzwords. Examples from rather different domains like industry, banking and insurance show that software systems tend to have hybrid structures. Hybrid inasmuch as they contain traditional information system parts as well as cyber-physical elements. Engineering such systems benefits from agile practices and demands for evolution support and different levels of system autonomy. In this presentation we present the main  challenges of digitization, we introduce a number of instruments for constructing and operating cyber-physical systems and we sketch typical architecture examples.</p>
