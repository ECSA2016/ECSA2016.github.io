		<td colspan="2">
		Engineers frequently neglect to carefully consider the impact of their
		changes to a software system. As a result, the software system's
		architecture eventually deviates from the original designers' intent and
		degrades through unplanned introduction of new and/or invalidation of
		existing design decisions. Architectural decay increases the cost of
		making subsequent modifications and decreases a system's dependability,
		until engineers are no longer able to effectively evolve the system. At
		that point, the system's actual architecture may have to be recovered from
		the implementation artifacts, but this is a time-consuming and error-prone
		process, and leaves critical issues unresolved: the problems caused by
		architectural decay will likely be obfuscated by the system's many
		elements and their interrelationships, thus risking further decay. In this
		talk I will focus on pinpointing the locations in a software system's
		architecture that reflect architectural decay, the points in time when
		that decay tends to occur, and the reasons why that decay occurs.
		Specifically, I will present an emerging catalogue of commonly occurring
		symptoms of decay -- architectural "smells". I will illustrate the
		occurrence of smells identified in the process of recovering the
		architectures of a large number of real-world systems. I will also discuss
		the relationship between architectural smells and the much better
		understood code smells. Finally, I will discuss several undesirable but
		common occurrences during the evolution of existing systems that directly
		contribute to decay. I will conclude by identifying a number of simple
		steps that engineers can undertake to stem software system decay.<br>

		Maarten van Steen is professor of large-scale distributed systems at
		the University of Twente. He heads the university's ICT-research
		institute, home to more than 400 PhD students and scientific
		staff. Key to the institute is conducting inter- and multidisciplinary
		ICT-based research. Before joining the University of Twente in 2015,
		
		Maarten van Steen was affiliated, for some 20 years, with VU
		
		University Amsterdam, where he was appointed full professor in
		
		2002. After being Director of Education for the Computer Science
		
		department's complete package of bachelor and master programs, Van
		
		Steen was appointed head of the department in September 2010.
		
		
		
		Since several years, a large part of his research is concentrated on
		
		understanding very large networked systems of small, wireless devices
		
		such as massive sensor networks. Next to such extreme distributed
		
		systems, his interests also reach out to complex-network science and
		
		understanding the behavior that emerges from very large networked
		
		systems. 
		
		
		
		Van Steen is author of several textbooks, including a freely
		
		accessible introduction to graph theory and complex networks. He is
		
		also co-author (together with Andrew Tanenbaum) of a highly successful
		
		textbook on distributed systems, which is currently being revised to
		
		its 3rd edition. He enjoys teaching, research, and management, and
		
		generally finds running a large department or institute to be much
		
		easier than understanding emergent behavior in computer systems.

		<td colspan="2">
		The field of computer science is rapidly changing, and we often barely
		
		seem to notice it. For years we have been working on the same topics,
		
		and many of us expect to continue do so for still a long time to
		
		come. Moore's law is no longer determining the speedups of our
		
		programs: new algorithms and insights are pushing us further to an
		
		extent that some believe we need to start worrying about Artificial
		
		Intelligence. Computer science is eating the world, and we're the ones
		
		responsible for that. Yet, we want to stay in control. I argue that we
		
		need get into a different mindset: let it go.
		
		
		
		A while back, I joined a team of experts on computational intelligence
		
		in an attempt to write a booklet on adaptive collective systems. It
		
		taught me a lot about how colleagues in the same field were looking at
		
		what's important in computer science. Coming from computer systems
		
		research, I dare say that my view is conservative. I see colleagues
		
		concentrating on software constructs often being conservative as
		
		well. We need to let a few things go.
		
		
		
		I will talk about adaptive collective systems as being a special type
		
		of distributed computer system in which control, or rather, the lack
		
		of control, plays a crucial role. Control is no longer fixed; it
		
		evolves through learning mechanisms. The take-away message is that our
		
		future distributed systems need to be architected with learning
		
		facilities. It is not obvious how this should be done, though.

		Much of our current day problems with automation software systems can be 
		attributed to the inherent flexibility that users’ actively seek in 
		software-driven automation control systems. Often, problems arise as 
		these systems are not effectively designed and tested to coexist with 
		other complex systems which generate vast and dynamic information 
		elements, including humans. With the arrival of IOT, automation products 
		have moved from electrical and process engineering components to complex 
		combinations of IO, hardware, networking and sensory devices and 
		software; often driven by ubiquitous connectivity brought forth by new 
		interaction technologies (voice, touch, etc.) and platforms (web, 
		mobile, etc.). Expectations from engineering automation however still 
		includes the need for a high degree of flexibility with complex embedded 
		software elements for data acquisition, coordination and monitoring; and 
		actively assisting the human in ‘correct’ decision-making. Issues 
		include assembling, integrating and analyzing information from disparate 
		sources in a timely, accurate and reliable manner, while meeting 
		real-time needs. Future automation systems, in spite of such greater and 
		wider automation, could well retain the human element in the decision 
		making loop for reflexive decision making skills, especially on those 
		that impact safety and security. These humans will be required to have a 
		higher degree of understanding of basic engineering and scientific 
		issues, exhibit critical decision making skills and possess keen 
		reflexes (perception and observation skills) to observe and react to 
		impending changes in the emergent scenarios. Hence, these automation 
		industry professionals are expected to have increased cross-disciplinary 
		knowledge, understand and deal with the increasingly dominant role of 
		technology, as well as operate effectively in an increasingly 
		multi-cultural and multi-ethnic, global work environment. In this talk, 
		I will outline and summarize some of the challenges, risks and 
		opportunities that lie ahead for such professionals, specifically from a
