				Cavtat is the most southern town in Croatia, and the most practical way to reach the town is by air.
				<a href="http://www.airport-dubrovnik.hr/index.php/en/">Ä†ilipi (Dubrovnik) airport</a> is just three miles away and it is well connected.
				The City itself has a population of 1,500 inhabitants,
				 and is a part of the Dubrovnik Riviera (twenty kilometers south of Dubrovnik, and 3 km of the main coastal highway).				
				<br><br>
				The Cavtat area abounds with Mediterranean vegetation which covers the whole area. Also, the sea in the Cavtat area is unpolluted and the city has a very attractive mixture of old and new architecture. Originally it was a Greek settlement called Epidauros.
		Around 228 BC it was under the Romans and later became a Roman colony. 
		The name Cavtat originates from Civets vet us, as the fugitives in the newly established Dubrovnik used to call their first habitation.<br>
