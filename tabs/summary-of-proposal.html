    We propose to organize the 10th edition of the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) in 2016 in Istanbul, Turkey. We are proposing Istanbul as the host city of ECSA 2016 as it is a unique city that <strong>links two continents</strong> - Asia and Europe and has a century old cultural history blended with modern lifestyle. Istanbul is one of the most attractive destinations in the World. It was the <i>"European Capital of Culture for 2010"</i>. Moreover, it is a <strong>facilitated connection point, which can be easily accessible</strong> from anywhere in the world. Besides Istanbul's historical importance and cultural heritage, the city is furbished with modern hotels, elegant restaurants, night clubs, bars, historical bazaars and modern shopping malls. Istanbul is a cosmopolitan city with many convenient hotels in different price categories.

    We propose the organization of the ECSA 2016 as a joint effort of leading software architecture researchers with intimate knowledge of the community and the key members of the steering committee of the biannual Turkish Software Architecture Design Conferences (UYMK). The steering committee of UYMK consists of both academicians and industrial partners who have extensive track record in software architecture research and practice and organizing various national and international events. The steering committee has organized the national software architecture conference in 2006 (Istanbul), 2008 (Izmir), 2010 (Ankara) 2012 (Izmir), and 2014 (Ankara). All these conferences were organized in a successful manner. Also, local organizers hosted International Workshop on Advanced Topics in Software Engineering (ATSEN 2014) event in Istanbul Kultur University successfully. <a href="http://atsen-conferences.org/">Atsen</a>.  Hence, we have full confidence in successfully organizing the tenth edition of a premier software architecture conference like ECSA.
