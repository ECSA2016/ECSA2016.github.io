		<td colspan="2">The European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) 
		is the premier European software architecture conference, providing 
		researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to present and 
		discuss the most recent, innovative and significant findings and 
		experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice.<br>
		The ECSA architecture tool demonstrations track provides an opportunity 
		for both practitioners and researchers to present and discuss the most 
		recent advances, experiences, and challenges in the field of software 
		architecture by means of live tool presentations. Motivated by big data, 
		data science and high-scalability application challenges, software 
		architects are constantly challenged to improve the observability of and 
		manage certain architectural health characteristics of systems. Tool 
		demo submissions addressing any aspect of tool support to help software 
		architects can belong in two distinct categories:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Tools used in 
		practice, either from commercial vendors or open-source projects. These 
		demonstrations should focus on practical applications within the 
		different activities of software architecting and should particularly 
		show how they advance the current state of the practice. New ideas and 
		features are particularly welcome.</li>
		<li>Research tools from academic or 
		industrial research environments. These demonstrations are intended to 
		highlight underlying scientific contributions and show how scientific 
		approaches have been transferred into a working tool.
		</li>
		</ul>
		Both categories may range from early prototypes to in-house or pre-commercialized products. Authors of regular ECSA research papers are also welcome to submit an accompanying tool paper and supplement additional information regarding the tool (such as multimedia, tool maturity) as described further under submission requirements.

			<li>have a maximum length of 4 pages, describing the technology or approach, how it relates to other industrial or research efforts, including references, and what the expected benefits are</li>
			<li>have an appendix (not included in the page count) that provides a brief description of how the presentation will be conducted, information on tool availability, maturity and the web-page for the tool (if one exists)</li>
			<li>state clearly the tool category: in-practice or research. In-practice tool demonstrations should also state whether they opt to be considered for inclusion in the proceedings</li>
			<li>be accompanied by a video (with audio commentary) of maximum 5 minutes length and of high resolution (details of the tool’s functionality should be clearly visible). The video should be uploaded on a video server (e.g. youtube) and the link should be included in the submission.</li>

		<td colspan="2">ECSA 2015 seeks three types of submissions to foster the 
		active participation of researchers and practitioners:
		<ul>
			<li>Full research papers and Experience papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that describe novel contributions to software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological basis and has been validated).</li>
			<li>Short papers (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present promising preliminary results from work-in-progress or research challenges in a topic of software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound basis, but perhaps has not been validated in full).</li>
			<li>Education and Training papers (max. 12 pages in LNCS style) that address challenges and best practices in in teaching and training of software architecture, such as methods, project management, and academia-industry collaborations.</li>
		</ul>
		Tool demo papers and accompanying multimedia artifacts will go through peer review process and will appear in the main conference proceedings.</td>
