    <h2 style="display:block;">CALL FOR ARCHITECTURE TOOL DEMOS</h2></header>
<p>
    The European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to present and discuss the most recent, innovative and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. The ECSA architecture tool demonstrations track provides an opportunity for both practitioners and researchers to present and discuss the most recent advances, experiences, and challenges in the field of software architecture by means of live tool presentations. Motivated by big data, data science and high-scalability application challenges, software architects are constantly challenged to improve the observability of and manage certain architectural health characteristics of systems. Tool demo submissions addressing any aspect of tool support to help software architects can belong in two distinct categories:</p>
<p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%;">
        <ul style="line-height:150%">
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Tools used in practice, either from commercial vendors or open-source projects. These demonstrations should focus on practical applications within the different activities of software architecting and should particularly show how they advance the current state of the practice. New ideas and features are particularly welcome.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Research tools from academic or industrial research environments. These demonstrations are intended to highlight underlying scientific contributions and show how scientific approaches have been transferred into a working tool.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</p>
<p>Both categories may range from early prototypes to in-house or pre-commercialized products. Authors of regular ECSA research papers are also welcome to submit an accompanying tool paper and supplement additional information regarding the tool (such as multimedia, tool maturity) as described further under submission requirements.</p>

    <h2 style="display:block;">SUBMISSIONS</h2></header>
<p>Submissions of papers for architecture tool demonstrations must:</p>
<p>
    <div style="margin-left:5%;">
        <ul style="line-height:150%">
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Follow the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM SIGS proceedings format</a> and be submitted through the ECSA Architecture Tools Demos track submission system at EasyChair.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Have a maximum length of 4 pages, describing the technology or approach, how it relates to other industrial or research efforts, including references, and what the expected benefits are</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Have an appendix (not included in the page count) that provides a brief description of how the presentation will be conducted, information on tool availability, maturity and the web-page for the tool (if one exists)</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> State clearly the tool category: in-practice or research. In-practice tool demonstrations should also state whether they opt to be considered for inclusion in the proceedings</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:3%;"> <b>*</b> Be accompanied by a video (with audio commentary) of maximum 5 minutes length and of high resolution (details of the toolâ€™s functionality should be clearly visible). The video should be uploaded on a video server (e.g. youtube) and the link should be included in the submission.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
