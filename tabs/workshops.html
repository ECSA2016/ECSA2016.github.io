Workshops at the 10th European Conference on Software Architecture 2016

</br>
</br>

Istanbul, Turkey, September 5-9, 2016

<header style="text-align:center; width:100%;">
    <h2 style="display:block;">OVERVIEW</h2></header>
<p>
    The 10th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) will be held from September 5th to September 9th, 2016 in Istanbul, Turkey (Istanbul Kültür University, Atakoy Campus). Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with ECSA 2016. Workshop topics should be related to software architecture and its applications. Example topics include (but are not limited to) architecture description languages, architecture analysis, validation and verification, architecture knowledge management, architecture and variability, system of systems architectures, architecting for the cloud, microservice architectures, architecture- based support for reconfigurable, adaptive or mobile applications, architectures for ultra-large-scale and long-lived systems, architectures for cyber-physical systems, sustainable architectures, software ecosystems, and software architecture education. Workshops at ECSA 2016 provide a forum for exchanging and discussing ideas and theories that are still at an early stage and before they have matured to warrant conference or journal publication. Typically, a workshop will either address a focused topic in depth or explore connections between topics that tend to be studied in loosely connected sub-communities. Workshops will be scheduled the day before the ECSA main conference. Workshops produce proceedings, which will include a workshop overview by the workshop organizers in addition to the papers accepted for the workshop. Participation in workshops is typically open but papers published in the proceedings are selected following a peer-review process. Papers accepted for the workshops will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
