            Security-related incidents are increasing, and at the same time our society is increasingly relying on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to monitor and measure security are needed to build secure systems, including IoT and cloud services, and to offer security evidence for system designers and users. Security analysis and measuring on software architecture level produces evidence of security in the design phase, to deal with requirement trade-offs. Architecture-level security analysis supports “security by design”. On the other hand, to understand overall security status and get a holistic view, architecture-level security analysis has to be extended to the operational system domain, and needs to include also the network level security monitoring and analysis. Thus, techniques to understand and scale the needs in both measurement and analytics are needed. Together these are able to provide the basis for security situational awareness in the modern complex software infrastructure. Security metrics also support security adaptation and architecture-based evolution.

            Several frameworks have been proposed to help the designers of software system applications. However, we currently lack methodological tool support to take into account the interplay between security and safety and the other architecture properties. The main focus of ISSA workshop is on the topic of making security and safety expert knowledge available to system and software engineering processes. Special emphasis will be devoted to promote discussion and interaction between researchers and practitioners focused on the particularly challenging task to efficiently integrate security and safety solutions within the restricted available design space for software systems. Furthermore, one important focus is on the potential benefits of the combination of model-driven engineering, formal methods with pattern-based representation of security and safety solutions. Some of the topics that we seek to include in the workshop are related to the development of concepts, modeling languages, evaluation and validation techniques, methods and tools to support the inclusion of security, safety and architecture issues into the software engineering process. We are inviting the submission of papers with high quality research contributions, work in progress, challenge problems, tool demonstrations, experimental and ongoing projects results.
