                Security-related incidents are increasing, and at the same time our society is increasingly relying on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to monitor and measure security are needed to build secure systems, including IoT and cloud services, and to offer security evidence for system designers and users. Security analysis and measuring on software architecture level produces evidence of security in the design phase, to deal with requirement trade-offs. Architecture-level security analysis supports “security by design”. On the other hand, to understand overall security status and get a holistic view, architecture-level security analysis has to be extended to the operational system domain, and needs to include also the network level security monitoring and analysis. Thus, techniques to understand and scale the needs in both measurement and analytics are needed. Together these are able to provide the basis for security situational awareness in the modern complex software infrastructure. Security metrics also support security adaptation and architecture-based evolution.

        <h2 style="display:block;">OVERVIEW</h2></header>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
        The 10th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) will be held from September 5th to September 9th, 2016 in Istanbul, Turkey (Istanbul Kültür University, Atakoy Campus). Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with ECSA 2016. Workshop topics should be related to software architecture and its applications. Example topics include (but are not limited to) architecture description languages, architecture analysis, validation and verification, architecture knowledge management, architecture and variability, system of systems architectures, architecting for the cloud, microservice architectures, architecture- based support for reconfigurable, adaptive or mobile applications, architectures for ultra-large-scale and long-lived systems, architectures for cyber-physical systems, sustainable architectures, software ecosystems, and software architecture education. Workshops at ECSA 2016 provide a forum for exchanging and discussing ideas and theories that are still at an early stage and before they have matured to warrant conference or journal publication. Typically, a workshop will either address a focused topic in depth or explore connections between topics that tend to be studied in loosely connected sub-communities. Workshops will be scheduled the day before the ECSA main conference. Workshops produce proceedings, which will include a workshop overview by the workshop organizers in addition to the papers accepted for the workshop. Participation in workshops is typically open but papers published in the proceedings are selected following a peer-review process. Papers accepted for the workshops will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
