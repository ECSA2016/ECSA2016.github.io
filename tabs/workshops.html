		<p>Distributed computing systems, by their very nature, consist of hardware and software components with spatial structures executing temporal 
		evolution of computations that are designed to deliver an intent. However as scale and fluctuations disturb the evolution often dictated by the 
		distributed computing system interacting with its environment, assuring the evolution to deliver the intent is often ad-hoc and results in complexity 
		and cost. There are calls for re-examining the distributed computing models to infuse cognition and thus introduce self-management properties 
		to cope with such changes and deliver the intent efficiently. This workshop is meant to address the current limitations and examine new approaches 
		to create self-managing distributed systems that improve resiliency, scaling and efficiency in delivering the system’s intent.

		<p>Cyber-physical systems have become complex and pervasive over time. They evolved from simple, single-task systems to systems with a large set of functionalities, connected to the Internet, distributed, multi-core, and with user-centric intuitive interfaces. Such new generations of embedded systems are so complex that the size of their code went from a few thousand lines to millions of lines. Such an evolution advocates for better software architecture adapted to such systems. This workshop aims at gathering both practitioners and researchers on these topics to explore the next generation of cyber-physical systems. Topics covered in the workshop are broad and cover all aspects combining software architecture and cyber-physical or embedded systems.

		<p>Many software systems are designed to support variability, either at design time or at runtime. Hence, variability is a key factor of most systems. Variability itself covers two dimensions: functional variability and variability in software qualities. While there are many works covering variability in functionality, there is a research gap regarding variability in software qualities. Obviously, this is an imbalance between the importance of variability in the context of quality attributes, and the intensity of research in this area. To improve this situation, the Workshop on Variability for Qualities in Software Architecture (VAQUITA) aims at investigating and stimulating the discourse about the matter of variability, qualities, and software architectures. VAQUITA offers researchers and practitioners a platform for exchanging ideas and experiences, analyzing research challenges, discussing open problems, and proposing promising solutions.

		<p>Software engineering education is on a different level of maturity in different countries. In many countries software engineering is still on the way to be established. The aim of this workshop is to attract faculties to discuss and provide successful examples and lessons learned about development of software engineering courses or a curriculum on bachelor and master level, as well as the ability to increase international collaboration.

		<p>Software ecosystems are becoming increasingly pervasive, leading to

		borders are all variants of ecosystems that come with their own 
		opportunities and threats at the same time. IWSECO and WEA aim to 
		further increase the body of knowledge about software ecosystems by 
		providing a forum to exchange ideas and discuss the most recent 
		innovations, trends and experiences in the field. They aim to build and 
		shape the community of leading practitioners and research experts by 
		providing forums for the exchange of research results and industrial 
		practice in software ecosystems. Co-organizing IWSECO and WEA will 
		provide a venue for practitioners and researchers to share their lessons 
		learned in two cross-cutting aspects of software ecosystems: (1) 
		business and social and (2) architecture and technology. The 
		co-organization allows us to attract and involve a larger group of 
		interested participants from the software architecture community.

		<p>The 1st International Workshop on Software Architecture Asset

		decisions involving Software Architecture and Software Assets (e.g. 
		components) for software-intensive systems. The SAADM workshop is highly 
		relevant for software architecture researchers and practitioners and

		<td colspan="2">
		<p>The more complex a software system is and the longer a software 
		system evolves, the more difficult it is to avoid effects like software 
		architecture erosion or architectural drifts. These effects can lead to 
		systems where the realization of the system diverges from the intended 
		architecture with resultant negative impacts on quality attributes 
		associated with the intended architecture. As studies have shown, 
		untreated divergence can lead to systems which are impossible to 
		maintain in the long run. Expensive redevelopments and replacements are 
		the consequences. In recent years, researchers from different communities 
		like software maintenance, model-driven development, and software 
		architecture have investigated many aspects of software architecture 
		erosion from different perspectives. The goal of the “Second Workshop on 
		Software Architecture Erosion and Architectural Consistency (SAEroCon)” 
		is to intensify the exchange of ideas regarding the current 
		state-of-the-art/the state-of-the-practice and future research 
		directions regarding architecture consistency, architecture recovery and 
		restoration and ways to prevent and mitigate against architecture 
		erosion. The workshop targets all software engineering researchers and 
		practitioners interested in discussing ideas regarding these topics and 
		shaping future research related to them.

		<td colspan="2">
		<p>There are numerous challenges, and rewards, in the development of 
		software architectures. Unsustainable, low-quality architectures perplex 
		collaboration, slow the progress of software evolution and reduce 
		proﬁts. It is crucial for software systems to be sustainable, i.e. to be 
		cost-efficiently maintained and evolved over their entire life-cycle, 
		whereas the sustainability of the system is largely determined by the 
		sustainability of its architecture. Designing a sustainable software 
		architecture is a non-trivial task, especially in the case of 
		large-scale and/or long-living systems. The task becomes even more 
		complicated when we take into account collaborative and intercultural 
		aspects of the software development, requirements traceability and big 
		data management. The goal of the SAGRA workshop is to develop a future 
		vision and roadmap of sustainable software architectures, focusing 
		especially on requirements engineering and methodological analysis, as 
		well as on collaborative and intercultural aspects. The workshop aims to 
		bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners from academia 
		and industry to baseline the state of the art in this increasingly 
		important domain.
