            Security-related incidents are increasing, and at the same time our society is increasingly relying on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to monitor and measure security are needed to build secure systems, including IoT and cloud services, and to offer security evidence for system designers and users. Security analysis and measuring on software architecture level produces evidence of security in the design phase, to deal with requirement trade-offs. Architecture-level security analysis supports “security by design”. On the other hand, to understand overall security status and get a holistic view, architecture-level security analysis has to be extended to the operational system domain, and needs to include also the network level security monitoring and analysis. Thus, techniques to understand and scale the needs in both measurement and analytics are needed. Together these are able to provide the basis for security situational awareness in the modern complex software infrastructure. Security metrics also support security adaptation and architecture-based evolution.
