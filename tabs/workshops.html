            Security-related incidents are increasing, and at the same time our society is increasingly relying on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to monitor and measure security are needed to build secure systems, including IoT and cloud services, and to offer security evidence for system designers and users. Security analysis and measuring on software architecture level produces evidence of security in the design phase, to deal with requirement trade-offs. Architecture-level security analysis supports “security by design”. On the other hand, to understand overall security status and get a holistic view, architecture-level security analysis has to be extended to the operational system domain, and needs to include also the network level security monitoring and analysis. Thus, techniques to understand and scale the needs in both measurement and analytics are needed. Together these are able to provide the basis for security situational awareness in the modern complex software infrastructure. Security metrics also support security adaptation and architecture-based evolution.

                The goal of the SAGRA workshop is to develop a future vision and roadmap of sustainable software architectures, focusing especially on requirements engineering and methodological analysis, as well as on collaborative and intercultural aspects. The workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners from academia and industry to baseline the state of the art in this increasingly important domain.</p>

                There are numerous challenges, and rewards, in the development of software architectures. Unsustainable, low-quality architectures perplex collaboration, slow the progress of software evolution and reduce profits. It is crucial for software systems to be sustainable, i.e. to be cost-efficiently maintained and evolved over their entire life-cycle, whereas the sustainability of the system is largely determined by the sustainability of its architecture. Designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-trivial task, especially in the case of large-scale and/or long-living systems. The task becomes even more complicated when we take into account collaborative and intercultural aspects of the software development, requirements traceability and big data management.

                <br>
                <p>
                    We propose to co-locate our workshop with the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA), since it is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent, innovative and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. Our workshop fits with the following topics proposed in the main conference: foundational principles of software architecture; quality attributes and software architectures; architectural design, analysis and evaluation, architecture-based evolution, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop brings together software architecture researchers and practitioners, and provides a forum for discussing and critically analysing ongoing research and emerging results on sustainability aspects of software architecture. Previous iteration of the workshop showed that there is interest in collaborations and discussions on this topics, and that there are now more questions than answers in this field. The workshop organisers are involved in research in this area and hope to build a community around this topic.

            Several frameworks have been proposed to help the designers of software system applications. However, we currently lack methodological tool support to take into account the interplay between security and safety and the other architecture properties. The main focus of ISSA workshop is on the topic of making security and safety expert knowledge available to system and software engineering processes. Special emphasis will be devoted to promote discussion and interaction between researchers and practitioners focused on the particularly challenging task to efficiently integrate security and safety solutions within the restricted available design space for software systems. Furthermore, one important focus is on the potential benefits of the combination of model-driven engineering, formal methods with pattern-based representation of security and safety solutions. Some of the topics that we seek to include in the workshop are related to the development of concepts, modeling languages, evaluation and validation techniques, methods and tools to support the inclusion of security, safety and architecture issues into the software engineering process. We are inviting the submission of papers with high quality research contributions, work in progress, challenge problems, tool demonstrations, experimental and ongoing projects results.
