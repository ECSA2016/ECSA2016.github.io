		active participation of researchers and practitioners:
		<ul>
			<li>Full research papers and Experience papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that describe novel contributions to software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological basis and has been validated).</li>
			<li>Short papers (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present promising preliminary results from work-in-progress or research challenges in a topic of software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound basis, but perhaps has not been validated in full).</li>
			<li>Education and Training papers (max. 12 pages in LNCS style) that address challenges and best practices in in teaching and training of software architecture, such as methods, project management, and academia-industry collaborations.</li>
		</ul>
		All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer review process, and be selected based on originality, quality, soundness and relevance. All accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by Springer-Verlag as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. In addition, authors of best papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers for a special Issue on “New Frontiers in Software Architecture” in the Journal on Systems and Software.</td>
