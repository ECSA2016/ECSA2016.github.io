Experience shows that organizations such as Turkish Telecom or Turkcell (largest GSM operator) have the tendency of being principal sponsors for such events. Moreover, local IT organizations including Microsoft Turkey, Oracle Turkey, etc. and other local players can be approached for seeking sponsorship for ECSA 2016. We have extensive experience in putting together an active team together for seeking sponsorships and support from public and private sectors. We have built a strong network of contacts who can be leveraged for a sponsorship drive. The "event counsellor" is expected to provide professional support for sponsorship seeking efforts. We can also arrange a “Barter type” of sponsorship. The "event counsellor" is quite expert to find such sponsors. Finally, the cost of "event counselling" and "public relation counselling" will be met by one of the potential sponsors. Hence, the plan is not charging the cost of professional support for the event to attendees.
